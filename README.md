# CodeQuest 2023 Submission
In the 2023 [CodeQuest](https://codequest.club/) programming competition, competiting teams had to create bots that competed against one another in a 1v1 top-down tank game, set in a destructable tile grid with bouncing bullets. This repository contains the python code of the bot submitted by team PLACEHOLDER NAME (consisting only of me) which won first place.
## Design Strategy
This bot was designed around using raycasting to predict where bullets would travel and bounce in order to guide our tank to victory. As all tiles are aligned to a square grid, simplified raycasting could be achieved through a modified [line rasterisation algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm). Raycasting would be done on all bullets every frame to determine their travel paths in the near future, if the raycast detected a collision, a new raycast with the appropriate angle of reflection would be performed to determine its trajectory after bouncing.
## Code Structure
The source code for the bot is located under `firstTry/src/`, with game.py containing most of the added bot behaviour and map.py containing the custom class to store tile data. bulletTrack.py was also a custom class originally added to handle bullet path predictions but is unused in the final bot.
